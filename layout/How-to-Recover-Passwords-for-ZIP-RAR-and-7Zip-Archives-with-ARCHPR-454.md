ARCHPR 4.54 is a powerful tool that can recover passwords or unlock encrypted ZIP, RAR and 7Zip archives created with any version of popular archivers. It supports various methods of recovery, including brute-force, dictionary and known-plaintext attacks. It also exploits some weaknesses of certain types of protection, such as the implementation flaw in WinZip 8.0 and earlier that allows guaranteed recovery in under one hour.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use ARCHPR 4.54 to recover passwords for your archives in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Download and install ARCHPR 4.54
 
You can download ARCHPR 4.54 from the official website of Elcomsoft, the developer of the software[^4^]. The trial version allows you to recover passwords up to four characters long. To unlock the full functionality, you need to purchase a license key for either the Standard or Professional edition[^5^]. The Professional edition has some additional features, such as support for AES encryption and \"password from keys\" attack.
 
After downloading the setup file, run it and follow the instructions to install ARCHPR 4.54 on your computer.
 
## Step 2: Launch ARCHPR 4.54 and select your archive
 
Open ARCHPR 4.54 and click on the \"Open\" button to browse for your archive file. You can also drag and drop your file into the program window. ARCHPR 4.54 will automatically detect the type and format of your archive and display some information about it, such as the compression method, encryption algorithm and file size.
 
## Step 3: Choose a recovery method and start the process
 
ARCHPR 4.54 offers four recovery methods: brute-force, dictionary, known-plaintext and guaranteed WinZip recovery[^5^]. You can select one of them from the \"Recovery\" tab and adjust some settings according to your needs.
 
- Brute-force attack: This method tries all possible combinations of characters until it finds the correct password. You can specify the length, character set and mask of the password to speed up the process.
- Dictionary attack: This method uses a list of words or phrases as possible passwords. You can use the built-in dictionaries or load your own custom dictionaries.
- Known-plaintext attack: This method requires you to have at least one file from the archive that is not encrypted or that you know the password for. It uses this file as a sample to find the encryption key for the rest of the archive.
- Guaranteed WinZip recovery: This method exploits a flaw in WinZip 8.0 and earlier that allows recovering passwords in under one hour regardless of their length or complexity.

After choosing a recovery method, click on the \"Start\" button to begin the process. You can pause or resume it at any time. You can also monitor the progress and estimated time on the status bar.
 
## Step 4: Recover your password and extract your files
 
When ARCHPR 4.54 finds your password, it will display it in a pop-up window. You can copy it to the clipboard or save it to a text file. You can also use it to extract your files from the archive by clicking on the \"Extract\" button.
 
Congratulations! You have successfully recovered your password and accessed your files with ARCHPR 4.54.
